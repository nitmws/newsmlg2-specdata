# NewsML-G2 Specification-related Data

This repository provides tools for generating data reflecting the IPTC NewsML-G2 specifications. Such data can be used for scripts or software processing NewsML-G2 data as reference.

This repository provides multiple make_* Python scripts, each one creates specific data. Each script has a .md file with the same file name as the script explaining the features of this script.

All these scripts are made for XML schema files as specification of an [IPTC NewsML-G2](https://iptc.org/standards/newsml-g2/) version. The XML schema files can be obtained from the IPTC webserver: start in the [NewsML-G2 branch](https://www.iptc.org/std/NewsML-G2/), select a version and go there to the specification folder.
